Hi! I'm Tim. I am a final year undergrad in the combined Honours Computer Science and Statistics Program at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, BC.

My program is great and all, but for the life of me I just can't seem to recall what kind of snack I was holding in this picture. Please let me know if you recognize what that is.

My current research focuses on Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Learning. Specifically, I'm developing robust and practical uncertainty quantification methods that aim to enhance the reliability of machine learning systems in human decision-making processes. Due to a surprising discovery along this path, I'm additionally investigating imbalancedness in pairs of transfer-learned neural networks, and how the scaling law there differ from classical ensembling methods. I am fortunate to have the amazing Professor [Geoff Pleiss](https://geoffpleiss.com/) as supervisor.

Peviously, I was an Research Assistant in UBC SPIN Lab to [give furry robots heartbeats and make them breathe](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spin/node/579) where I studied the impact of a personâ€™s haptic interaction with an affective, zoomorphic robot on their cognitive reappraisal success. As the lead on robotics software on the Happraisal Project, I developed real-time softwares that enabled us to control the robot movements in real-time through tetherless communication, and simultaneously collect high-frequency data from a suite of physiological sensors that the human participants wear. I worked closely with [Preeti Vyas](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~pv/) and [Bereket Guta](https://bguta.github.io/), supervised by Professor [Karon Maclean](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/karon-maclean). This work was demoed at Eurohaptics 2024.
