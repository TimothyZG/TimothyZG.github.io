I am a first-year PhD-track Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at UBC, co-advised by Dr. [Geoff Pleiss](https://geoffpleiss.com/) and Dr. [Evan Shelhamer](http://imaginarynumber.net/research/).
I'm interested in application-driven deep learning research, particularly in self-supervised vision foundation models, uncertainty quantification, computational efficiency, and multi-modeling.

My undergraduate honours thesis focused on uncertainty quantification in deep learning, where I developed [Asymmetric Duos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18636), a computationally efficient method for improving the predictive uncertainties of large neural networks in high-risk applications.

Peviously, I was a research assistant in UBC SPIN Lab (HCI & Robotics), where I [gave fluffy robots heartbeats and made them breathe](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spin/node/579).

Outside of research, I am an enthusiastic, albeit mediocre, bird watcher, and perform with UBC Acappella.
