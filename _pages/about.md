I recently completed a Combined Honours degree in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, BC.

Starting September 2025, I will be a PhD-track Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at UBC, co-advised by Dr. [Geoff Pleiss](https://geoffpleiss.com/) and Dr. [Evan Shelhamer](http://imaginarynumber.net/research/).

I'm interested in application-driven deep learning research, with a focus on human-centric design, trustworthiness, and robustness.

My undergraduate honours thesis focused on uncertainty quantification in deep learning, where I developed [Asymmetric Duos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18636), a computationally efficient method to improve ML systems' predictive uncertanties in high-risk applications.

Peviously, I was a research assistant in UBC SPIN Lab, where I [gave fluffy robots heartbeats and made them breathe](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/spin/node/579), supervised by Dr. [Karon Maclean](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/karon-maclean).

Outside of research, I am an enthusiastic, albeit mediocre, bird watcher, and perform with UBC Acappella.
